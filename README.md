# Backbone.js with handlebar and routing example

Project includes sample to use backbone routing, view, model, collection

To see a demo go here: http://ankitdhir.github.io/Backbone-MVC/

we are also using dynamic routing and dynamic template loading

to start project use any web server

### How routing works?
In backbone you can define routing in a method which extends Backbone.Router you can pass parameter and get value of parameter
  now either use in same function or pass it using app variable.

### How to use handlebars?
  I am using dynamic template loading using common method defined in app.js code is completely commented, just browse
  and check use of every method
